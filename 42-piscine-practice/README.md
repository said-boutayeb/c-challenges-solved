## 📖 Learning Objectives

Through these exercises, I'm developing skills in:

- **Basic I/O Operations**: Using `write()` and standard output
- **String Manipulation**: Working with characters and strings
- **Parameter Handling**: Processing command-line arguments
- **Control Structures**: Loops and conditionals
- **Memory Management**: Understanding pointers and allocation
- **Algorithm Design**: Problem-solving and optimization

## 🎯 Goals
